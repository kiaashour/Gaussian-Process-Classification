# Gaussian Process Classification

Comparing different methods of Gaussian process classification with logistic regression. The GP methods are detailed in [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.2005) and [here](http://gaussianprocess.org/gpml/chapters/RW.pdf).

## Setting up environment with necessary packages

```
conda create --name GPC python=3.8
conda activate GPC

pip install GPy
pip install statsmodels
pip install sklearn
pip install jupyter
